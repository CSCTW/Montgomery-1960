    Welcome to Montgomery 1960!  In this experiential learning mobile application game, we will try to look through the eyes of Alabama State University college students to see how they handled situations on their campus.  You are being transported to the actual events to learn what you can to meet today’s challenges.  Your quest is to learn from the past to respond to a hate “situation” on UT’s campus.  Things are getting heated and there is no telling what will happen next.
