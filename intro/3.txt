You select the historical event to be transported into and are given a Newspaper with Headlines to access different aspects of the historical events. The Newspaper will guide you through the different Headline stories and the characters that were involved in the Headline events. Once a Headline story is selected, you are given a choice of which character (your personal comparator) to play throughout the Headline.

LEVEL ONE-----
In level one of the game (the first 3 headlines), you will be asked to become the character and fully “take their perspective”. The challenge will be to understand the character whose life you inhabited well enough to know what they did and why.  You uncover your Comparator’s lived experience through primary documents and their personal stories. You may progress with the game only if you successfully answer questions about what they did next.
-----LEVEL TWO-----
In the second level, you select a Comparator to act in the place of throughout the entire set of headline events. You will be transported through the Comparator’s entire experience and make a final decision answering the question asked in the Headline. To complete the first of the Level 2 Headlines, play the Comparator least like you and then play the Comparator most like you in the 2nd Level 2 Headline.
