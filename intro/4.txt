Throughout your quest, you will discover various artifacts from the historical moments in which you
participate. Your first and most essential artifact is the Newspaper, which acts as your portal to all
Headlines for each event. As you play each Comparator you will be given access to primary source information that reveals their experiences, actions, and perspectives. The more carefully you  consider these artifacts, the better you will understand the Comparator and allow their perspectives to teach you how to successfully conclude your quest and use these lessons to face today’s challenges.

You live in a democratic society rocked by identity-based disagreements. Across all spectrums, our
populace fear being increasingly oppressed. The subsequent discord and animosity makes it difficult for
the mechanisms of a democracy to function. Things are getting heated, and there is no telling what will
happen next. You receive an invitation to a meeting with leaders within your community to discuss
options for going forward. Your first instinct is to wonder “Who am I?” to step into a leadership role in
this moment. You hesitate to accept when suddenly your phone buzzes.  You have received a message
from The Brooks, a secret society of time traveling defenders of our civilization. They invite you to join
their ranks.
