Welcome to Montgomery 1960!  In this experiential learning mobile
application game, we will try to look through the eyes of Alabama
State University college students to see how they handled situations
on their campus.  You are being transported to the actual events to
learn what you can to meet today’s challenges.  Your quest is to
learn from the past to respond to a hate “situation” on UT’s campus.
Things are getting heated and there is no telling what will happen
next.
