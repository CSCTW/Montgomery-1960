We are The Brooks, a secret society of time traveling defenders of our civilization. You have been selected to join our ranks as a Defender of Tomorrow, and we await your assistance on our next mission. The challenges facing our leaders can leave them feeling caught up in events beyond their control. We prepare our Defenders by giving them the ability to inhabit and learn from the lived experience(s) of key participants in historical moments. This historical training develops skills which allow our Defenders to become leaders that can manage the turbulence.

The Newspaper is your portal to various events in the past.  Select from the different Newspaper articles to read about that event, then decide whether to play through that event as one of the characters listed or to exit and view another article. Please scroll to Montgomery, Alabama.------------Those Choice Communiques will look like our swirling logo. Do you accept your appointment as a The Brooks Defender?
