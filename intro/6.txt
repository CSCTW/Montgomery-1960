----- In early February 1960, Alabama State College students decide whether to participate in the Greensboro NC College Student Sit-in Movement to desegregate lunch counters in the South.

The demonstrations sweeping the south came to Montgomery today. Montgomery County deputies ousted 39 college students from a local diner. The students of Alabama State College fulfilled Dr. Martin Luther King’s prediction from earlier this month. They attempted, but failed, to integrate a segregated lunch counter at the Montgomery County Court house this morning, February 25th. The rumors of the threatened protests proved true and Montgomery can anticipate more to come.
The students entered the diner in the basement of the Montgomery County Courthouse, sat at tables, and asked for service. Students stayed for 15 minutes and moved to the hallway when directed by police.

The students complied with Sherriff Mac Sim Butler's instructions to not be disruptive or block the halls. Unlike other student protests, the police did not arrest the students. Later that afternoon, Governor Patterson ordered ASC President Trenholm to expel the protesting students. The Governor “threatened to withhold state funds and also demanded a full scale investigation”. That evening protestors delivered the student statement about the sit-ins to the newspaper office. Dr. Trenholm distributed mimeographed messages to the student body directing them not to continue the demonstrations.
The next morning a large group of students returned to the courthouse. They again left when asked returning to campus to rally and give speeches on the steps in front of the campus cafeteria. Dr. Trenholm instructed a group of the student leaders (including Bernard Lee, Joseph Peterson, and Elroy Embry) not to hold rallies on campus. The Governor has not commented on the continued protests.
