  The university president invited you to a meeting to discuss the event and options going forward.  Our question is what should you do as a personally and socially responsible student leader at UT in responding to this moment/event after you have interacted with the game?

  In this game, the Newspaper will guide you through the different Headline stories and the characters that were involved.  You will have the chance to play through the stories as various characters while learning from the text, acquiring artifacts, and working within your small group to be the most prepared for the in-class discussions.
